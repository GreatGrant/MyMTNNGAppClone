# MyMTNApp NG Clone (Learning Project)

This is a personal learning project where I recreated the core UI and user experience of the official MyMTNApp NG mobile application.  
It is **not affiliated with or endorsed by MTN Nigeria** or any of its subsidiaries.

## üö® Important Notes on Licensing

### üî§ Fonts
The original MyMTN app uses **MTN Brighter Sans**, a proprietary font licensed for personal use only.  
This project replaces it with the open-source [**Manrope**](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Manrope) font for all public code and builds.  
üëâ **MTN Brighter Sans font files are not included** in this repository.

### üî§ Want to use MTN Brighter Sans font locally?
By default, this project uses the open-source [Manrope](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Manrope) font to keep it open and safe for sharing.
But if you have access to **MTN Brighter Sans** and want to use it locally for personal builds:

1. **Download the font on your computer**

2. **Place the font files** (e.g. `MTNBrighterSans-Regular.ttf`, `MTNBrighterSans-Bold.ttf`) in your project `assets/fonts/` folder:


3. **Update your `pubspec.yaml` like this:**
```yaml
flutter:
  fonts:
    - family: MTNBrighterSans
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/MTNBrighterSans-Regular.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/MTNBrighterSans-Bold.ttf 
```        
4 **Update your theme file `(app_theme.dart)` like this:**
```yaml
   const kFontFamily = 'MTNBrighterSans';
   ```

### üü° Logos and Branding
This project **does not include** any official MTN logos, icons, or branding.  
Any logo seen in screenshots or local builds is either a **placeholder** or used **only for personal testing purposes** and not meant for public or commercial use.

### üñº Carousel Images
Some original promotional images from the official app were replaced with royalty-free or placeholder images in this public version to comply with copyright rules.

## üì¶ Usage

This project is intended **only for educational and personal learning purposes**.  
Do **not**:

- Distribute the app or content in a way that suggests affiliation with MTN.
